Allows me to redirect some websites to others that I like more (for whatever reason).

Unfortunatelly [userscripts](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) does not achieve the exact same behavior. The redirection when using it is slightly slower.

An alternative is [redirect-web](https://github.com/mshibanami/redirect-web) which is amazing but I think it's easier to add the rules by code than by an interface.

Therefore I decided to write an iOS Safari Extension. This may serve as inspiration for others.
